# Image-text Relation Classification Test Set

The data set contains images attached to the tweets, tweet IDs, text, and a manually annotated relation class between the image and tweet text. 
The relation classes are similar to the ones in the paper "[Categorizing and Inferring the Relationship between the Text and Image of Twitter Posts](https://aclanthology.org/P19-1272/)"

Relations:
---------

    0 - The image ADDS to tweet meaning and tweet text IS represented in the image
    1 - The image ADDS to tweet meaning but tweet text is NOT represented in the image
    2 - The image does NOT ADD to tweet meaning but tweet text IS represented in the image
    3 - The image does NOT ADD to tweet meaning and tweet text is NOT represented in the image
